# JAAA-lang

## Requirements:  gcc, Java and make

## 1 - Install dependencies

### Install lex
```
sudo apt-get install flex
```

### Install yacc
```
sudo apt-get install bison
```
## 2 - add executable permission to jaaa file
```
chmod +x jaaa
```
## 3 - Write your .jaaa program and compile it

### Compile .jaaa file to a c generated binary
```
./jaaa /path/to/myFile.jaaa
```
Output: myFile

### Compile .jaaa file to java bytecode
```
./jaaa -b /path/to/myFile.jaaa
```
Output: myFile

## Comments

When executing `./jaaa -b /path/to/myFile.jaaa` it generates a executable
file `myFile` but it is a script that executes the real binary which is `Main.class`
located on the same directory.
So if you want to share or transfer the bytecode of your program, the file you
need is `Main.class` and not `myFile`. Also everytime you compile generating java
bytecode this file is overwritten with the new generated bytecode, so if you want to
save a previous bytecode and compile a new program you need to move `Main.class` to
other location.

On the essay located on Documentation we explained the reason for this.
